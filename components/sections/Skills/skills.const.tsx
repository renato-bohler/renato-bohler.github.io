          <strong>JavaScript</strong> was the first programming
          language I had contact with when I was 12. At that time,
          I&apos;d create websites just for fun.

            JavaScript is the programming language I&apos;m the most

          I started learning JS because I used to build

          <strong>TypeScript</strong> is one of those things that you
          might ask yourself: <em>&quot;why do I need that?&quot;</em>{' '}
          â€” but when you get used to it, you&apos;ll never look back.

          To be honest, when I first heard about TypeScript, I did not
          get super hyped. My first experience with types in
          JavaScript was with Flow + AngularJS, and the lack of proper
          documentation made the whole experience a kind of a mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when I started using TypeScript professionally in 2019,
          everything changed. TypeScript makes everything much more
          explicit, easy, and reliable that{' '}
          <strong>
            it&apos;s hard for me to think about starting a new
            project without it these days

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          I do realize that not everything about TypeScript is
          perfect, though. Libraries with incorrect or incompatible
          typings can be a pain to deal with. Also, assigning the
          correct type for complex scenarios gets hard pretty fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          But TypeScript has come a long way. Having such a great
          community also helps: any problem you might have has
          probably already been solved by someone (Google for the
          rescue ðŸ˜…).

        <p>
          Interested in developing native Android applications, I
          started studying Java around 2014. At that time, I developed
          some Android apps for personal use but never actually
          released them (or their source codes).

        <p>
          One of those apps, for instance, was an{' '}

          module that acted as an SMS blocker, built by
          reverse-engineering the default Android SMS app. This app
          allowed me to overcome the fact that Android 4.4 (KitKat){' '}

            messages
